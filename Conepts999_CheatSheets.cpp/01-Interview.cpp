# 📝 Stages of an Interview

> Most algorithmic interview rounds are between **45-60 minutes**.  
> The interview can be broken down into stages. At each stage, there are multiple things you can do to maximize your chances of success.

---

=> 1 ⃣ Introductions

- At the start, the interviewer will usually:
  - Briefly introduce themselves and their role at the company.
  - Ask you to introduce yourself.

✅ **Tips for you:**
- Prepare and rehearse a **30-60 second intro** → education, work experience, and interests.
- Smile and speak with confidence.
- Pay attention when they describe their role → useful for asking questions later.
- If you share an interest with them (work-related or hobby), mention it.

---

=> 2 ⃣ Problem Statement

- After introductions, the interviewer will present the **problem statement**.
- Usually, they paste the description (and test case) in a shared editor and read it aloud.

✅ **Steps:**
1. Confirm your understanding:
   - Paraphrase the problem back to them.
2. Ask clarifying questions:
   - Will the input only have integers or other types?
   - Sorted or unsorted input?
   - Can input be empty?
   - What about invalid inputs?
3. Ask about **expected input size**:
   - Small `n` → brute force or backtracking might work.
   - Medium `n` (100-1000) → maybe `O(n²)` solutions.
   - Large `n` → need better than `O(n²)`, maybe `O(n log n)` or `O(n)`.

💡 Walk through given examples to confirm understanding.  
👉 Asking clarifying questions shows attention to **edge cases**.

---

=> 3 ⃣ Brainstorming DS & A

- Break the problem down → recognize common patterns.
- Think about **what DS/Algorithm** is applicable.

✅ **Best Practices:**
- **Think out loud** → shows your reasoning & tradeoff analysis.
- Example: If problem involves subarrays → mention sliding window idea.
- Once you have a possible solution:
  - Outline rough steps before coding.
  - Explain them clearly to the interviewer.
  - Stay receptive to hints → they want you to succeed.

💡 Practice LeetCode regularly to sharpen this skill.  

---

=> 4 ⃣ Implementation

- Once the approach is clear → **start coding**.

✅ **Coding Do`s:**
- Ask if libraries/modules are allowed before importing (e.g., `collections` in Python).
- Explain decisions while coding.
- Write **clean, readable code**:
  - Follow language conventions (case style, spacing, indentation).
  - Avoid duplicated code (use arrays for directions, helper functions, loops).
- Use **helper functions** → makes code modular.
- If stuck, **communicate** concerns with the interviewer.

💡 Strategy:  
- Implement a **brute force** first → acknowledge its inefficiency.  
- Then, try to optimize step by step with interviewer`s input.

---

=> 5 ⃣ Testing & Debugging

Different environments you may face:

=># (a) Built-in test cases, auto-run
- Similar to LeetCode.
- Covers edge cases, huge inputs, and tricky scenarios.

=># (b) Write your own test cases, code runs
- Shared editor supports execution.
- Write test cases yourself and call the function.

=># (c) Write your own test cases, code doesn`t run
- Shared editor only, **manual walkthrough** required.
- Keep track of variables while simulating code.

✅ **General Testing Tips:**
- Cover: edge cases, intuitive inputs, and invalid cases (if required).
- If code breaks:
  - Don`t panic.
  - Use print statements or walk through manually.
  - Explain expected vs. actual values as you debug.

---

=> 6 ⃣ Explanations & Follow-ups

After coding:

- Be ready to answer:
  - **Time & space complexity** (worst-case, sometimes average-case).
  - **Why you chose** a data structure or algorithm.
  - **Can it be improved?**

⚠  Don`t claim optimality unless sure → it`s okay to be wrong, not okay to be confidently wrong.

- If time remains:
  - Either new problem (restart from Step 2).
  - Or follow-ups (new constraints, optimize space, etc.).

💡 Understanding > Memorization → know **why** a solution works.

---

=> 7 ⃣ Outro

- Last few minutes → interviewer lets you ask questions.  
- You can`t improve the outcome much here, but you **can harm it** if uninterested.

✅ **Good Questions to Ask:**
- What does an average day look like here?
- Why did you choose this company?
- What`s your favorite/least favorite thing about the job?
- What kind of projects can I expect?

💡 Bonus: Read company`s tech blog → prepare smart questions.  

👉 Always appear interested, engaged, and positive.  
👉 Don`t look bored → soft skills matter just as much as coding.

# ✅ Final Notes
- Interviews are **two-way conversations**.  
- Be clear, confident, and collaborative.  
- Show structured thinking, coding clarity, and curiosity.
