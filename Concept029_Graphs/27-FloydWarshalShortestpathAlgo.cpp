// Floyd Warshal Shortest path algorithm

// Unlike Dijkstra and Bellman Ford algorithms, which find the shortest path from a single source to all other vertices,
// It finds the shortest path from multile sources to multiple destinations.

// It is used to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).
// The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where the value at row i and column j represents the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j.
// If there is no edge between two vertices, the weight is represented as infinity (or a very large value).

// User function template for C++
