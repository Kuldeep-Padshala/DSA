// An articulation point (or cut vertex) is a vertex in an undirected graph whose removal increases 
// the number of connected components in the graph.
// In other words, if you remove an articulation point from the graph, it will disconnect some part of the graph 
// that was previously connected.

// To find all articulation points in a graph, we can use a modified Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. 
// The key idea is to keep track of the discovery time of each vertex and the lowest discovery time reachable 
// from that vertex using back edges.

// If the lowest reachable vertex from a subtree rooted with a vertex v is below v in DFS tree,
// then v is an articulation point.
// Note: A root of DFS tree is an articulation point if it has two or more children.
