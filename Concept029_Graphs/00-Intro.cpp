// Graphs

// so graphs are a collection of nodes and edges
// nodes are also called vertices
// edges are connections between nodes

// a graph can be directed or undirected
// a directed graph has edges that have a direction (from one node to another)
// an undirected graph has edges that do not have a direction (the connection is bidirectional)

// a graph can also be weighted or unweighted
// a weighted graph has edges that have weights (costs, distances, etc.)
// an unweighted graph has edges that do not have weights

// a graph can be cyclic or acyclic
// a cyclic graph has at least one cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same node)
// an acyclic graph does not have any cycles

// a graph can also be connected or disconnected
// a connected graph has a path between every pair of nodes
// a disconnected graph does not have a path between every pair of nodes

// a graph can be represented in various ways
// the most common representations are adjacency matrix and adjacency list
